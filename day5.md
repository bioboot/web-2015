# Day 5.  Unified Analytical Group Projects 
On the final day of this bootcamp, we will group up with the other members of our table and embark on a joint effort to take what we have learned this past week and use it to explore a large-scale biological data set in a collaborative fashion. We will make use of the [Geuvadis Project](http://www.geuvadis.org/web/geuvadis/RNAseq-project) which combines data on genetic variation from the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org/) with gene expression measurements derived from RNA-sequencing generated in [Lappalainen et al, Nature 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918453/) to detect and visualize potential expression quantative trait loci ([eQTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_quantitative_trait_loci)). 

Typically, such research projects can take a very long time to generate the data and analyze the results. For the purposes of this bootcamp, we will be using a small subset of these data and will attempt to recreate the published results over these regions. Our goal is to give you a taste of what types of data exploration are now available to you with the simple yet powerful biocomputing tools you have learned and to serve as a foundation for your future research endeavors.
